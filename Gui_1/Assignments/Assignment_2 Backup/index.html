 I am going to start making a portfolio page for my artworks, and is
 and is going to try to make is as intereactive as possible.
 In the index page will serve as the front page fo the website. In this
 assignment or first build, i tried using linking tool and the table tool.
 I included an image for the first page and also made a button that you can
 click on to go to the gallery page. It is just an image with a link embedded in
 it.h
